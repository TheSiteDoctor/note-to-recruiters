# About the Akkroo Note To Recruiters

This **Note to Recruiters Policy** was created to help recruiters looking to establish a working relationship with us to build the best possible relationship, and help us reduce the overheads of managing the administriative side of recruitment.

This stems from two issues:

* Recruiters phone a lot, and we work better by email
* There are many recruiters to co-ordinate

The original idea was set up by [vzaar](http://vzaar.com) after doing several rounds of recruitment. They found the overhead from dealing with recruiters and recruiting agencies exceeded their capacity as a team to manage the process effectively.
 
A better process was needed and, drawing heavy inspiration from [Shutl: Note to Recruiters](http://shutl.com/note-to-recruiters) and [Moo: Hello Recruiters](http://uk.moo.com/about/recruiters.html), we created this policy.

Since this may be of use to other companies out there they shared it. Feel free to use this text verbatim, or altered to suit your business.

Please fork it, change it. Also, if you feel there are changes that would benefit the source material, submit a pull request.
