# Note for Recruiters

## Introduction

Recruiting is time consuming for small companies. We have no specialist team to deal with recruiting, it’s just us!

We all have other work to be getting on with, and we’re happy to work with recruiters if it makes our lives easier. However experience has shown that this is not always the case, and many recruiters work in such a way that it adds a lot of workload to our process [see some of those reasons!](overhead_reasons.md).

Please read our rules for working with us below. We want to build good relationships with good recruiters, and we will only put our effort into agencies that are able to work in a common way we can accomodate.

Unfortunately, agencies and recruiters who don't respect our wishes will be added to our internal blacklist (there are enough companies out there to work with who are accomodating to these basic asks!).

## Policy

#### Phone Calls
* Do not call us. We do not take unsolicited calls for recruitment, ever! Unsolicited calls are a fast way to make sure we won't work with you.
* If we're working together regarding a role or candidate, we'll explain how best to contact us about that role/candidate.

#### Positions
* If you want to know about available jobs, keep an eye on our [https://akkroo.com/jobs](jobs page) or twitter feed.
* Each position will have its own specific application process, to which we need to add you first. Please contact us first about being able to recruit for a role so we can set you up in our application process which attributes candidates back to you.
* Read the role. Do not send contractors if we specify permanent staff. Do not send PHP developers for a Rails position.

#### CVs /  Candidates
* Do not send us anonymous CVs - they will not be considered. If you send us a candidate, we want to know who they are, where they've worked and whether we've seen them before.
* When sending us a CV, please include the candidate's salary expectations and availability.
* We typically only consider candidates already in the UK. If they are not in the UK, please tell us.

#### Unacceptable practices

_Doing any of these will result in being automatically blacklisted and we won't work with you:_

* Do not lie to us. Common examples of this include phoning and say you know us when you don’t. Do not tell the person answering the phone a different story to the person who you are trying to get hold of.
* Do not try to poach our staff. The whole team/office can hear when there is a recruiter on the line trying to do this. This makes both the person you’re speaking to uncomfortable, as well as the team around them.
* Passing on details of candidates you’ve placed to other recruiters to try to poach them after you’ve received your fee.


## Terms & Fees

_These Terms supersede any similar terms in individual agency's contracts._

* We will not sign your terms and conditions. 
* We will pay 15% of year 1 base salary.
* We will pay within 30 days of invoicing.
* The invoice date can be no earlier than the candidate's start date.
* If a candidate is employed by us within 6 months of an introduction by you, we will pay your fee.
* If a candidate you introduce is already known to us (organically or from a different agency) we will tell you this promptly. No fee will be payable in this circumstance.
* If the candidate leaves within 12 working weeks of their start date (for any reason, including dismissal), you will try to find a replacement free of charge.
* If you are unable to find a replacement acceptable to us you will refund 8.3% of your fee for each week of the first 12 the candidate didn't work.
